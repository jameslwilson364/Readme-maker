# README Maker

- Description: The goal of this project was to create a README maker using node from the terminal window. The projected aimed to capture user inputs from each of the six sections outlined for the user. The project also provides a selectable list of licenses and will display the license with its associated badge. The README will provide links to the user's github and email address. This README file was generated with the README Maker.
